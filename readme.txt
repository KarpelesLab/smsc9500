        - Add support for automdix overide strap. 
 
6. Known Issues 
---------------------------- 
    - When using operational_mode=1 (which is not the not the driver's 
      default), we have observed that the device could become unusable  
      if a USB hot swap is performed while stressing active traffic  
      (i.e. ping flood) is ongoing. We have determined this to be  
      caused by a bug in the linux kernel v2.6.25 and higher related to  
      handling of periodic transactions. While the kernel patch currently  
      being proposed (http://marc.info/?t=121837892200003&r=1&w=2) solved  
      that particular problem it introduced others, so it is not a good  
      solution. Once a stable kernel patch for this issue is available 
      this problem should be resolved. 
 
    - On some Linux distributions such as Centos, "pcscd" daemon keeps accessing
      LAN9500/LAN9500A/LAN9512 device for some reasons, which prevents LAN9500 
      device from entering suspend state.  To solve this problem, You can disable
      it by typing "chkconfig pcscd stop".
    
   - To enable autosuspend automatically, add following lines into the file /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules
		ACTION==”add”, SUBSYSTEM==”usb_device”, SYSFS{idVendor}==”0424”, SYSFS{idProduct}=="9500",RUN+=”/bin/sh -c 'echo auto > /sys/$DEVPATH/device/power/level'”
		ACTION==”add”, SUBSYSTEM==”usb_device”, SYSFS{idVendor}==”0424”, SYSFS{idProduct}=="9e00",RUN+=”/bin/sh -c 'echo auto > /sys/$DEVPATH/device/power/level'”
		ACTION==”add”, SUBSYSTEM==”usb_device”, SYSFS{idVendor}==”0424”, SYSFS{idProduct}=="ec00",RUN+=”/bin/sh -c 'echo auto > /sys/$DEVPATH/device/power/level'”	
      You may have to replace vendor id and product id with your own customized IDs.
      
   - When netdetach is enabled, you have to setup network configuration script to bring up network interface automatically.
   		Suppose smsc9500 Ethernet interface is eth0. Add following lines into /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. 
			DEVICE=eth0
			ONBOOT=no
			BOOTPROTO=static
			IPADDR=192.168.1.40   
	
7. Driver Initialization parameters 
----------------------------------- 
 
There are several possible parameters for each driver module 
 
 a. smscusbnet.ko 
        - operational_mode:  
            0:      low_latency mode. Device uses bulk in pipe continuous  
                    reader for ethernet rx. This is the default mode. 
            1:      low power mode. Device uses the interrupt pipe to  
                    detect ethernet rx, only then submits bulk in's to  
                    read rx data. Once no rx data available stops bulk in 
                    submissions. 
        - rx_queue_size:    controls the size of the rx queue 
                    default is 5 
        - tx_queue_size:    controls the size of the tx queue 
                    default is 5 
        - tx_hold_on_completion 
                    default is true (enabled). If set the driver will not submit a new 
                    bulk out urb until all previously ones submitted complete 
        - tx_use_prealloc_buffers 
                    default is true (enabled). If set the driver will use the pre-allocated 
                    buffers for usb tx submission. 
        - rx_use_prealloc_buffers 
                    default is true (enabled). If set the driver will use the pre-allocated 
                    buffers for usb rx submission. 
 
 b. smsc9500.ko 
        - link_mode:  A bit wise field that specifies any combination of 4 or fewer  
                      link speeds 
            0x01:   10HD 
            0x02:   10FD 
            0x04:   100HD 
            0x08:   100FD 
            0x10:   Symmetrical Pause 
            0x20:   Asymmetrical Pause 
            0x40:   Auto Negotiate 
        - auto_mdix:    allows overide to strap in order to control phy's automdix  
                        behavior 
            0:      Disable AMDIX, Straight Cable 
            1:      Disable AMDIX, CrossOver Cable 
            2:      Enable AMDIX 
            3:      Controlled by Strap 
        - mac_addr_hi16 & mac_addr_lo32: allow Ethernet Mac address overide. 
        - scather_gather: enabled kernel S/G support (needed for tx_Csum) 
        - tx_Csum:  Default to 0. Set to 1 to enable hw tx checksum support 
        - rx_Csum:  Default to 0. Set to 1 to enable hw rx checksum support 
        - phy_addr: Default to 1 and using internal phy. Set to appropriate  
                    values if connecting an external phy. 
        - TurboMode: receive mode 
            0:      One receive packet per bulk in transaction 
            1:      Multiple receive packet per bulk in transaction 
        - debug_mode: controls amount of debug verbosity (see debugging below) 
         
        - linkdownsuspend: 
            0:  Disabled. 
            1:  Enabled with normal power savings (recommended for maximum compatibility) 
            2:  Enabled with maximum power savings. 
             
        - LinkActLedCfg: if true, enable hardware driven LED configuration on LAN9500A. Only  
        		 applies to LAN9500A.  
        - LinkLedOnGpio: Selects the GPIO number (in the range 0 to 10) use for link status  
                         indication. If this parameter is not specified, the LED handling  
                         is the original hardware default for combined link/activity pin. 
        - LinkLedBufType: if enabled (will be only if LinkLedOnGpio is used), set GPIO port  
                         buffer type as open-drain. Otherwise, it is push/pull.  
        - LinkLedPolarity: if enabled (will be only if LinkLedOnGpio is used), GPIO output  
                         will be low active. Otherwise, will be high active. 
	- dynamicsuspend: if enabled, suspend device automatically if no 
			traffic for 3 seconds, then waking up device if any Tx/Rx traffic.  
	- netdetach: if enabled, detach device from USB bus if link is down, then re-
			attaching device to USB bus if link is back.  
        - MdioDisable: default 0 
            bit 0: when set disables all internal access to phy. 
            bit 1: when set disables IOCTL access to phy 
        - MdioDefaultLinkStatus: applicable only when MdioDisable is set. default 1 
            bit 0: reports link up after initialization. 
     
8. External PHY setting
	This applies to all lan95xx compatible devices that support the external PHY mode in the hardware.
	Change the following lines in the driver source code. 

	Case 1:

	smsc9500 driver supports an external PHY. It can search for the PHY connected to it. There is no change required if there only one PHY on the MDIO bus.

	If there are multiple PHYs on the MDIO bus (ex: when Ethernet switch LAN9303 is connected in PHY mode) it is required to specify the PHY address attached to LAN95xx device.

	The below line in the smsc9500.c file need to be changed.

	u32 phy_addr=0xFFFFFFFFUL; //Specify the PHY id

	Case 2:

	If there is MDIO/MDC lines are not connected to PHY (or some MACs do not have this pins), the PHY access need to be disabled in the driver. Please change below lines in smsc9500.c file:

	MDIO_Disable =3;  //This disables all the access to MDIO registers.

	u32 link_mode=8; // The link by default comes-up as 100FD. This should match the PHY link speed.

	u32 MdioDefaultLinkStatus=1; //Default link status reporting (1 for UP)

	Case 3:

	Some external PHYs do not have the IEEE compatible register sets. The driver cannot get the meaningful PHY status by reading PHY registers via MDIO/MDC. Also, some PHYs may need initialization or user/application may need to read/write PHY registers. The PHY registers can be accessed via driver IOCTLs. The command line tool cmd9500 can be used to read/write PHY registers.

	u32 phy_addr=0xFFFFFFFFUL; //Specify the PHY id

	MDIO_Disable =2;  //This disables internal driver access to MDIO registers. The IOCTL access to read/write PHY registers allowed.

	u32 link_mode=8; // The link by default comes-up as 100FD. This should match the PHY link speed.

	u32 MdioDefaultLinkStatus=1; //Default link status reporting (1 for UP)

9. Debugging 
------------ 
     a. You can use the debug_mode insmod parameter to control printk verbosity  
        of this driver. See DBG_xxx #defines in smsc9500.h for details. 
 
     b. The cmd9500.c provides several useful commands that can facilitate runtime  
        debugging by allowing register manipulations and/or giving access to internal 
        driver data. See it's usage page DisplayUsage() for details.
